# SupConSTFT
A supervised contrastive learning model with three lanes to process STFT images extracted from EEG signal.
    1. a high frequency feature extraction lane
    2. a low frequency feature extraction lane
    3. a temporal feature extraction lane

Below a TSNE plot from extracted representations is depicted, where the input data was the C3 EEG channel and the labels are sleep stages.
